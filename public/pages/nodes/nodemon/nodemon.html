    Nodemon is a tool for Node.js development that helps to automatically restart the Node.js application when changes are made 
    to the source code. This can be very useful during the development process, as it eliminates the need to manually stop and 
    restart the application each time a change is made.
</p>
<p class="para">
    Nodemon works by watching the files in the application's directory and restarting the application whenever a change is detected. 
    This includes changes to JavaScript files, JSON files, and other files that the application may be using. Nodemon also monitors the 
    application's console output, and will restart the application if it crashes or throws an error.
</p>
<p class="para">
    Nodemon can be installed using npm, the Node.js package manager, with the following command: 'npm install -g nodemon'
</p>
<p class="para">
    Once installed, nodemon can be run by navigating to the directory containing the Node.js application and typing the command: 'nodemon app.js' 
    where app.js is the main entry point file of the application.
