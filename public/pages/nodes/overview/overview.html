        Node.js, the server-side JavaScript runtime environment. It is built on top of the Google Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, 
        and it's mainly used to create web servers.
        Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!

        A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O
        primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using
        non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
