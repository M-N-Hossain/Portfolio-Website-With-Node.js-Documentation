        The 'package.json' file is a configuration file used in Node.js applications to specify metadata about the application and its dependencies. 
        It is usually located in the root directory of a Node.js project and is automatically generated when creating a new Node.js project using 
        'npm init' command.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        The 'package.json' file includes several fields that describe the application and its dependencies, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            name: 
            <p>
                The name of the application.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            version:
            <p>
                The version number of the application.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            description: 
            <p>
                A brief description of the application.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            main: 
            <p>
                The entry point file of the application.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            dependencies: 
            <p>
                A list of production dependencies required by the application.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            devDependencies: 
            <p>
                A list of development dependencies required for development and testing purposes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            scripts: 
            <p>
                A set of commands that can be run using the 'npm run' command.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            repository: 
            <p>
                The URL of the Git repository where the application's source code is stored.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            license: 
            <p>
               The type of license that the application is released under.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="para">
        The 'package.json' file is also used by Node Package Manager (npm) to install, manage, and update dependencies for the application. 
        When a developer runs 'npm install' command, npm reads the 'package.json' file and installs all the dependencies listed in the 'dependencies' 
        and 'devDependencies' fields.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        In addition to specifying metadata and dependencies, the 'package.json' file also allows developers to specify various configurations, 
        such as environment variables, build scripts, and other project-specific settings.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        Overall, the 'package.json' file is an essential part of Node.js development, providing a standardized way to manage dependencies and 
        configure Node.js applications.
